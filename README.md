The purpose of this project is to develop a tool that encrypts a payload in AES (one of the safest encryption algorithms) and saves it in an encrypted file, thus guaranteeing an AMAZING obfuscation, causing difficulties for an AV to detect.

*It is important to remember that there are other obfuscation techniques and evasion techniques that can be used in addition to encryption, such as using malicious code inside legitimate files, using packers and crypters to obfuscate the code, and so on.*

**The use of these tools is for teaching purposes, research and assistance to the Red Team team. Use with care!**
